# Project Name
To Do List Weekend Challenge

## Description
I created a to-do list website where users can add tasks to a database, mark them as completed, and delete them from the list. When tasks are marked as completed, their text turn grey and the "Completed" button is shown as a solid green. When the user marks an task as completed or deletes the task, that is reflected in the database.
